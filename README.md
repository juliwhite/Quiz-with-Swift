This program is made in Swift language, I created a trivia game. The user will be ask to play a game and then it will start to answer the 10 questions. 
The program is made of 10 questions that the player will need to check the correct answer, if the user fail to answer the correct answer then points will not be added to their score. 
If the user answered correctly then he will gain 1 points. 

I created a simple program to play in Swift. The Trivia game it needs one player.
